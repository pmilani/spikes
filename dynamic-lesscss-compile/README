This project shows using a servlet filter to compile on-the-fly LESS stylesheets.
This is intended to ease development, rather than for production environments.

This can be run from Eclipse: run as Java application the JettyMain class.
Then browse: http://localhost:8080/

There are 2 demos to show how changing styles and reloading works: 
- client side JS interpreter of LESS stylesheets
- server side LESS to CSS rendering

SERVER SIDE DESCRIPTION
There is a servlet filter chained on top of a 'default servlet' instance.
The default servlet serves static content out of the webapp content folder.
By mapping the filter to intercept all requests for *.css, the filter locates LESS 'source' stylesheets.
If there is a LESS stylesheet it is rendered and streamed back to the browser as CSS.
If there is no LESS stylesheet, the filter falls back on the http filter chain for handling the request.

This example setup allows for mixing static CSS files with dynamically generated CSS from LESS source files.
